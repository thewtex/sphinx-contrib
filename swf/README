swf Sphinx Extension
====================

This package contains the swf Sphinx extension.

It adds a directive `swf` for improved flash file handling.

You can pass any parameter mentioned on `flash attribute listing`_.

.. _flash attribute listing:

I stumbled across the issue, that screencasts often are "zoomed in", such
that you do not have access to controls. So this directive has a
"zoom-to-fit" option, which zooms out the video using javascript.

Example::
    .. swf:: path/to/your.swf
       :zoom-to-fit: true
